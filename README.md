# Creddie

Creddie is a very simple transaction API that you can self-host.

The purpose of Creddie is to let you quickly record what you are spending your money on and save it.

Instead of using Google Forms / Google Sheets to collect / analyze your spending data, Creddie provides a simple way to record and save this data for use in any analyzing program.


### Setup

1. Create a .env file with your variables. See `example.env`
2. Install Docker and just run `run.sh`
